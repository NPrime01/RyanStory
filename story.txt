There once was a student named Ryan.
One day while Ryan was taking his Math exam he forgot how to perform one
type of integration.

Though he tried and tried, he just couldn't remember how to do integration by parts. His efforts proved to be fruitless despite his efforts, causing him to panic and worry.
